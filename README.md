# The Missing Download Menu

> âš  **Heads up**: This is a major rewrite from v1 and includes some highly requested features from the community. As a design decision, I ditched FAST DNA and replaced React with Angular.

This plugin provides a menu in your Chromium based browser that shows all recent downloads in a non-obstrusive way. Not more or less, it's simple as that.

Built with [Angular](https://angular.io), uses [Fluent Icons](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/styles/web/icons).

## Features
- [x] Access your downloads from your menu bar
- [x] Automatic dark and light mode
- [x] Integrates well to Edge's design system
- [x] Search
- [x] Also works on Chrome
- [ ] Disables download shelf
