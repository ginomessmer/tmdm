![TMDM - The Missing Download Menu](./docs/img/social_alpha.png)
This plugin is designed to provide a menu in your Chromium based browser that shows all recent downloads in a non-obstrusive way. Not more or less, it's simple as that.

Built with [React](https://create-react-app.dev/) and [FAST-DNA](https://fast.design/).

## Features
- [x] Access your downloads from your menu bar
- [x] Automatic dark and light mode
- [x] Integrates well to Edge's design system
- [x] Search
- [x] Also works on Chrome
- [ ] Disables download shelf

Do you have any feature requests? Let me know or tweet [@ginomessmer](https://twitter.com/ginomessmer).

## Development setup
I recommend to either **using WSL or a Linux environment for development** since the npm scripts are tailered for these environment. You'll need to have yarn installed.

### Debug extension
- First time? Do `yarn` to install all dependencies
- Build the extension with `yarn build`
- Go to Edge -> Extensions -> Turn on Developer Mode
- Hit `Load unpacked` and select to the root of the `./build` folder
- Happy debugging
